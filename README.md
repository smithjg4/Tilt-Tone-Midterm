# Tilt-Tone-Midterm
A gyroscope is tilted to change the frequency of a buzzer in a similar fashion to a theremin.

An Arduino-Uno is the microcontroller being used. The 3-axis gyroscope is part of the GY-80 10 DOF chip, and is used to find the angular velocity of the sensor which can be used to detect tilting. This tiliting can then be used to change the pitch of the buzzer.
